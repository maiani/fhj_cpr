[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/598846697.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/598846697)

This repository contains the code used to generate the data in the paper *Nonsinusoidal current-phase relations in semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator devices*.
The dataset files are included in the Zenodo archive.

## Contents of the repository
 - `fhj_live.ipynb`  : Notebook to run the diagonalization for a single set of parametrs.
 - `fhj_run.ipynb`   : Notebook to create a dataset of CPRs for a 2D parameter space.
 - `fhj_post.ipynb`  : Notebook to plot a dataset of CPRs for a 2D parameter space.  
 - `environment.yml` : Conda environment file.
 - `paper_figures`   : Folder that contains the results of the simulations and the custom code to recreate the plots in the paper.
